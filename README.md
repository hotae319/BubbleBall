# Bubble ball code Description

## Structure
* To use 2 python scripts for public, you can go to the BubbleBall Challenge repository.
* This is for actual implementation to play this game.
* To test my code, you should have bubble-ball execution file of Linux version from Nay Games.
* It includes a python package named `functions` and `main.py` in the `bubble-ball-ubuntu-18.04-x86` directory.

## Prerequisite
* Required to have **automate.json, movableObjects.json, bb.log, movableObjects.json, levels directory** in the same folder as this code. (Usually, the directory name is `bubble-ball-ubuntu-18.04-x86-64-x.x` (I cannot upload this here.))
* Of course, you should have a bubble-ball game execution file.

## How to use 
* Ex) level 2 (It is already selected in __main__.)
1. Locate the `functions/` and `main.py` in the `bubble-ball-ubuntu-18.04-x86` directory.
2. `main.py` can import any module from `functions` package. 
3. If you wanna check each function module such as local_region algorithm, you can do it separately.
